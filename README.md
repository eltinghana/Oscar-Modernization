# Platform Modernization & Multi-Tenancy Roadmap

Version: 2025-08-10  
Owner: Elvis Addae
Status: Draft (Initial)

# Executive Summary (Non-Technical Overview)
We are transitioning from a costly, fragile "one customer = one server" model to a secure, pooled, modern cloud platform. This enables scaling from 100 to 2000+ clinics without a linear cost explosion, while improving security, reliability, speed of feature delivery, and compliance readiness. The change is incremental (no risky big-bang rewrite) and front‑loads risk reduction (security, operations) before deeper refactors. Net result after 18–24 months: 60–75% lower infrastructure cost per tenant, releases in hours (not weeks), 99.9%+ availability, and a security posture aligned with healthcare regulations.

Top 5 Business Outcomes:
1. Cost Efficiency: Pooling resources & automation drive major reduction in per-tenant infrastructure & support overhead.
2. Faster Time-to-Market: Modular architecture + CI/CD accelerates feature rollout → competitive differentiation & higher retention.
3. Security & Compliance: Modern frameworks, dependency hygiene, audit controls reduce breach & regulatory risk.
4. Reliability & Patient Safety: High availability & resilience patterns reduce downtime that affects clinical workflows.
5. Scalable Growth: Platform can absorb a 20× client increase without a 20× operations team.

Investment Snapshot:
- Phase 0–2 (first 6 months): Primarily platform engineering & security hardening (foundational, low user disruption).
- Phase 3–4 (months 6–15): Dual-run legacy + modern modules; visible UX improvements begin.
- Phase 5 (months 15–24): Optimization & advanced compliance automation.

ROI Drivers (Illustrative):
- Current VM model (estimate): 8 GB / 4 vCPU per tenant ~ (assume) $160–$220 monthly infra blended → 2000 tenants ≈ $3.8M–$5.3M/yr.
- Pooled cluster (post-optimization): ~0.35–0.4 GB avg RAM & fractional vCPU per tenant with autoscaling → projected $1.0M–$1.4M/yr.
- Net annual infrastructure savings: $2.5M–$3.9M (reinvest partly into product & security).
- Productivity gains (DORA improvements) reduce opportunity cost & accelerate revenue features.

Risk Mitigation Approach:
- Start by shielding & measuring (security layers, logging) before replacing internal components.
- Strangler pattern ensures rollback paths & limits blast radius.
- Feature flags & canary deploys reduce release risk.

KPIs Tracked Monthly for Exec Dashboard:
- Cost / Tenant, Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Availability %, Security Vulnerabilities (open >30 days), p95 Latency, Tenant Onboarding Time.

## 1. Context & Drivers
Current deployment = 1 VM (Tomcat + MySQL) per tenant (8 GB RAM / 4 vCPU / 50 GB disk). 100 clients now; forecast 2000 in 24 months. Operating 2000 dedicated VMs is cost prohibitive, operationally risky, and slows dev velocity. Legacy tech stack (Struts 1.x, Spring 2.x/3.x, Hibernate 3, Axis2, assorted outdated libs) increases security exposure and inhibits rapid feature delivery.

Primary goals:
- Cost & operational scalability (multi-tenancy + pooled infrastructure)
- Strong security & compliance posture (healthcare data)
- High availability & resilience (SLO-driven)
- Developer productivity & delivery velocity
- Incremental evolution (avoid big-bang rewrite) while reducing legacy risk

## 2. Guiding Principles
1. Strangler pattern over rewrite; coexist legacy & modern modules.  
2. Security & tenancy isolation tests are blocking gates.  
3. Small, reversible increments (≤2 weeks) shipped continuously.  
4. Observability, automation, and compliance baked in from inception.  
5. Prefer managed/cloud-native services to reduce undifferentiated ops.  
6. Modular monolith first; extract services only for clear scaling/ownership wins.  

## 2a. Business Value & ROI Overview
| Value Pillar | Problem Today | Modernization Lever | Benefit Metric | Target (12–18 mo) |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Cost | 1:1 VM → linear cost | Multi-tenancy, autoscaling | Cost/tenant ↓ | -60% to -75% |
| Growth Capacity | Ops cannot handle 10× | Automation, orchestration | Tenants/Eng FTE ↑ | >150 per FTE |
| Security & Compliance | Legacy CVEs, weak central control | Updated stack, DevSecOps, IdP | Open critical vulns | 0 >30 days |
| Reliability | Single-instance fragility | HA cluster, resilience patterns | Availability | ≥99.9% |
| Delivery Speed | Slow releases | CI/CD, modular code | Lead time | <24h |
| Customer Retention | Performance issues, downtime risk | Performance tuning, SLOs | Churn rate ↓ | (Set baseline) |

Executive Narrative (Plain Language): We are turning a collection of individually managed servers into a single, smart, auto‑scaling platform. This reduces waste, makes updates safer, and strengthens defenses around sensitive health data. The plan balances quick protective wins with a measured transformation of the codebase.

## 3. Target Reference Architecture (Iterative End State)
- Frontend: SPA (React/Vue) + BFF (REST/GraphQL) gradually replacing JSP/Struts.
- Backend: Java 17+ Spring Boot 3 modular services (Auth, Billing, Patient Records, Scheduling, Documents, Labs Integration, Notifications).
- Tenancy: Shared app layer; per-tenant MySQL schema (phase 1) → optional shared schema with tenant_id & row-level security (phase 2, only if necessary).
- Data: Managed MySQL cluster (Aurora / equivalent) + read replicas for analytics; Redis for cache + sessions; Object storage (S3) for documents.
- Messaging/Eventing: Kafka (or cloud alternative) for integrations, audit, async workflows.
- Identity & Policy: External IdP (Keycloak/Auth0) OIDC + fine-grained authorization (OPA / policy engine) + audit trail.
- Ingress: API gateway / Ingress controller with WAF, rate limiting, TLS termination, security headers.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry (metrics, logs, traces) → Prometheus / Grafana / Loki / Tempo (or managed).  
- CI/CD: Trunk-based, pipeline enforcing SAST, SCA, secrets scan, tests, SBOM, deploy automation (ArgoCD / GitOps recommended).
- Security Controls: Vault-managed secrets, KMS encryption, CIS hardened base images, runtime policy (Falco / eBPF), container image signing (cosign).
- Resilience: Multi-AZ, HPA, circuit breakers (Resilience4j), feature flags, blue-green / canary deployments.

### 3b. Can We Deploy the Code “As-Is”? What Must Change and Why
**Short Answer:**  
- **True pooled multi-tenant deployment (Kubernetes + shared DB cluster): _No, not without changes_.** The current application assumes per-tenant server isolation and local state, which blocks horizontal scaling and safe tenancy isolation.  
- **Interim container-per-tenant lift-and-shift: _Mostly yes_, with targeted changes** (externalized config, health checks, Redis sessions). This enables early wins while refactoring for proper multi-tenancy.

#### Minimum-Change Lift-and-Shift (Phase 1–2)
- Containerize the WAR (multi-stage Docker build).  
- Externalize configuration to environment variables / ConfigMaps; move secrets to Vault.  
- Add `/health` and `/ready` endpoints for orchestrator readiness.  
- Redis-backed sessions to eliminate sticky session requirements.  
- Temporary persistent volume for unavoidable local writes, with planned migration to object storage.  
- Deploy in isolated namespaces or workloads per tenant initially, then consolidate after tenancy readiness.

#### Why “As-Is” Won’t Work for the Pooled End State
| Area | Current Likely Behavior | Why It Blocks Modern Ops | Required Change |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Session Management | Tomcat in-memory sessions | Breaks stateless scaling & resilience | Redis sessions (P1), token-based auth (P3) |
| File Storage | Local disk for uploads/reports | Containers are ephemeral; no HA | Object storage (S3/Blob) (P2) |
| Config & Secrets | Properties files per VM | No automation; insecure | Env/config maps; Vault secrets (P1) |
| Health & Readiness | No endpoints | Cannot autoscale safely | `/health` & `/ready` checks (P1) |
| Background Jobs | Quartz/Cron in web app | Jobs restart/fail on pod reschedules | Dedicated workers or clustered jobs (P3) |
| Tenancy Resolution | DB-per-VM assumption | No tenant isolation in pooled app | Tenant context + datasource routing (P2) |
| AuthN/AuthZ | Legacy login/session | Weak central control; no MFA/SSO | OIDC integration; centralized policy (P3) |
| Libraries & Runtime | Outdated frameworks | Security & compatibility risk | CVE-free upgrades; Java 17 path (P3) |
| Logging & Tracing | Unstructured logs | No tenant-level observability | JSON logs; trace/tenant IDs; OpenTelemetry (P1) |
| Reporting | Heavy sync exports | Latency spikes & timeouts | Async processing via queue (P4) |

#### Early Proof Points
- **Phase 1:** Container image, config externalization, Redis sessions, health endpoints (pilot 5–10 tenants).  
- **Phase 2:** Per-schema tenancy, automated DB migrations, object storage for documents.  
- **Phase 3:** OIDC integration, façade module for new endpoints, move long-running jobs out of web tier.


## 4. Phased Roadmap (Quarters are illustrative)
### Phase 0 (Weeks 0–4) Immediate Triage
- Add SBOM (CycloneDX or Syft) + OWASP Dependency-Check / Snyk to build.  
- Reverse proxy (NGINX/Envoy) in front of tenant VMs: TLS, HSTS, CSP, rate limiting.  
- Central log aggregation (Fluent Bit → OpenSearch/ELK).  
- Secrets vault (HashiCorp Vault / cloud service); remove plain creds from properties.  
- Structured logging JSON + correlation IDs (tenant, request).  
- SECURITY.md & disclosure process.  
- Inventory & classify all third-party libs (risk register).  

### Phase 1 (Months 2–3) Containerization & Config Externalization
- Create Dockerfile (multi-stage) for legacy WAR (Java 8 baseline).  
- Externalize environment-specific settings via env vars / config map / secrets.  
- Add basic health/readiness endpoints (if absent) for orchestrator.  
- Introduce Redis (sessions) to eliminate Tomcat sticky need.  
- Pilot Kubernetes (or ECS) cluster with 5–10 tenants (mirror traffic for testing).  

### Phase 2 (Months 3–6) Multi-Tenant Consolidation
- Migrate all tenants from per-VM to pooled cluster (scalable replicas).  
- Consolidate MySQL: Per-tenant schema in managed DB cluster; automation for schema creation, migration, backup, PITR.  
- Autoscaling (HPA) + resource limits tuned from utilization metrics.  
- Implement per-tenant resource dashboards & isolation tests.  

### Phase 3 (Months 4–9) Modernization Foundations
- Begin Java 17 upgrade path (multi-module build, dual CI lane).  
- Introduce Spring Boot 3 façade module; proxy new REST endpoints to legacy internals.  
- Bounded context mapping & modular monolith refactor (Billing, Patient, Documents, Labs, Auth).  
- Replace / wrap Struts 1 actions gradually (new features only in Boot).  
- Replace Commons-DBCP → HikariCP; Joda-Time → java.time; outdated libs upgrade (log4j2 latest, commons-fileupload, jsch, Quartz 2.x).  
- Keycloak (OIDC) integration; central JWT issuance; deprecate custom auth.  
- Add OPA (or simple ABAC) for tenant/role/resource policies.  

### Phase 4 (Months 9–15) UI & Domain Decoupling
- New SPA for high-traffic modules (Patient dashboard, Scheduling).  
- Event bus (Kafka) for async document generation, lab ingestion, notifications.  
- Extract Auth + Document Generation + Notification as independent services (if bounded context stable).  
- Implement resilience patterns (circuit breakers, bulkheads, retries).  
- Enhanced audit trail (immutable, signed).  

### Phase 5 (Months 15–24) Scale, Optimization, Compliance
- Additional service extraction only where justified (Labs, Billing).  
- Performance tuning (DB indexing, caching layer for static code sets).  
- Active-Active multi-region optional (if latency / DR requirements).  
- Row-level tenancy refactor (optional) if schema-per-tenant becomes operationally heavy.  
- Compliance automation: Evidence collection, policy as code, continuous pen-test integration.  
- Supply chain hardening (Sigstore signing, SLSA level progression).  

## 5. Critical Legacy Risks & Mitigation
| Component | Current | Risk | Mitigation (Short Term) | Long Term |
|-----------|---------|------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Struts 1.2.7 | EOL | CVEs RCE | Shield w/ WAF & input validation | Replace with Spring Boot controllers |
| Spring 2.x/3.x | EOL | CVEs | Constrain attack surface | Migrate to Spring Boot 3 |
| Hibernate 3.4 | Old | Performance / security | Limit new usage | JPA/Hibernate 6 module |
| Axis2/CXF old | 1.5.4 / 2.7 | CVEs | Restrict endpoints & patch | Replace with REST/FHIR or updated SOAP only where mandated |
| Quartz 1.8.5 | Old | Missed bug fixes | Contain background jobs | Quartz 2.x or event-driven scheduling |
| Commons-FileUpload 1.3.3 | CVEs | Upload exploit | Validate, AV scan | Servlet 3 multipart or updated lib |
| jsch 0.1.49 | Older | Crypto issues | Limit usage | Upgrade or alternative library |
| Joda-Time 1.4 | Deprecated | API errors | Wrap usage | Migrate to java.time |

## 6. Tenancy Strategy
Phase 1: Per-schema tenancy: (db_{tenant_id}). Pros: Clear isolation, easy backup/restore, simpler migration. Cons: Schema count growth (indexes mgmt automation needed).
Phase 2 (optional): Shared schema w/ tenant_id, row-level security & partitioning. Only if operational/maintenance overhead of >2000 schemas becomes burden.
Automation required: Schema provisioner service, versioned migrations (Flyway/Liquibase) applied in parallel (or rolling) with success/failure reporting & rollback.

## 7. Data & Migration
- Inventory all schema differences across existing tenant DBs; standardize baseline before consolidation.  
- Dual-write tests (shadow) for new persistence module when upgrading ORM.  
- PITR & per-tenant logical backups; periodic restore drills (at least quarterly).  
- Large tables (documents, audit) → consider partitioning & low-cost storage tier (S3 + index metadata).  

## 8. Security & DevSecOps
Controls matrix (OWASP ASVS alignment) – maintain in separate spreadsheet / repo. Highlights:  
- Build-time: SBOM, SAST, SCA, secret scan, IaC scan.  
- Deploy-time: Image signing, admission controller (verify signature, block critical CVEs).  
- Runtime: WAF, RASP (optional), eBPF runtime anomaly detection, centralized IAM, least privilege service accounts, network policies (K8s).  
- Data: At-rest encryption (DB, object storage, backups), TLS in transit, key rotation schedule.  
- Auth: OIDC flows, MFA for staff; API tokens short-lived with refresh; service-to-service mTLS / SPIFFE (future).  
- Authorization: Policy engine evaluation per request; deny by default; audit decision.  
- Logging/Audit: Tamper evident, immutable store (append-only + hash chain).  
- Incident Response: Runbooks, on-call rotation, attack simulations (tabletop + red team light).  

## 9. Observability
- Metrics: p95 latency, error rate, saturation (CPU/mem), DB query latency, queue lag, per-tenant request volume.  
- Logs: Structured JSON; fields: timestamp, traceId, spanId, tenantId, userId, action, status, latencyMs.  
- Traces: Instrument high-value flows (login, patient lookup, lab ingest) first.  
- Alerts: SLO burn rates (fast/slow), anomaly detection for memory leaks, DB connection pool exhaustion.  

## 10. CI/CD Pipeline (Reference)
Stages:  
1. Compile + Unit Tests (mvn verify).  
2. SAST/SCA/Secrets (fail on critical).  
3. Build container + SBOM + sign image.  
4. Integration tests (ephemeral env w/ ephemeral schemas).  
5. Contract & isolation tests (enforce tenant boundaries).  
6. DAST + performance smoke.  
7. Canary deploy (progressive traffic) + automated rollback on error budget burn.  
8. Promote to production (GitOps merge).  

## 11. Bounded Contexts (Initial Draft)
- Auth & Identity
- Patient Records (core EMR)
- Scheduling & Appointments
- Billing & Claims
- Documents & Media (storage, generation, conversion)
- Labs & Integrations (HL7/FHIR ingest)
- Notifications (email/SMS/push)
- Reporting & Analytics

Maintain ADRs for any context split or service extraction.
